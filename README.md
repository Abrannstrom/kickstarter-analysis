# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this module, I was assigned to analyze data from various fundraisers in order to indentify relationships between variables such as launch dates and funding goals.  With the help of Excel I will deliver charts that hopefully give us insight into some of the conditions that cause fundraisers to succeed or fail.  
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to give us students a better understanding of how to wield the tools of Excel.  Through this project, we will gain experience with Excel syntax, pivot tables and charts. 
## Analysis and Challenges
We analyzed the Kickstarter data by using various filters, calculating percentages, and making charts. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I started by making a pivot table of the Kickstarter data.  Then I set the filters to "Parent Category" and "Years", put the launch dates in rows,  and i set the outcomes in columns and the count of outcomes as the summation value. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I made a new sheet and a "Goal" column like the one below in order to identify trends of outcomes based on goals.

I used the "COUNTIFS()" statement in Excel to populate the successful and failed columns.  Then I calculated the percentages of each and inserted a chart to display the results.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Populating the columns of the previous section proved to be quite difficult and I'm not sure why my second chart didn't match the one that was given.  Some of the tasks were tedious and I manually input a lot of statements into the Excel columns. In the future I hope to be able to use Excel more efficiently.   
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- Fundraisers succeed at a higher rate between May and July. 
- Those fundraisers do worse in the winter and especially in December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  The size of the goal of a fundraiser negatively correlates with the success rate. 
  
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  Its small size and the small time frame it considers.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  Outcomes based on country or category.
