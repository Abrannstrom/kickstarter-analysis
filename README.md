# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this module, I was assigned to analyze data from various fundraisers in order to indentify relationships between variables such as launch dates and funding goals.  With the help of Excel I will deliver charts that hopefully give us insight into some of the conditions that cause fundraisers to succeed or fail.  
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to give us students a better understanding of how to wield the tools of Excel.  Through this project, we will gain experience with Excel syntax, pivot tables and charts. 
## Analysis and Challenges
We analyzed the Kickstarter data by using various filters, calculating percentages, and making charts. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I started by making a pivot table of the Kickstarter data.  Then I set the filters to "Parent Category" and "Years", put the launch dates in rows,  and i set the outcomes in columns and the count of outcomes as the summation value. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
